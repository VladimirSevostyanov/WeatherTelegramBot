WeatherTelegramBot <br/>
Go to telegram and look for @BotFather. <br/>
Create a new bot, name it and get an API that needs to be entered into TOKEN_API in config.py. <br/>
Go to Openweather https://openweathermap.org. Register and go to "My API keys". <br/>
Create your API key, copy it and paste it into token_weather in config.py. <br/>
After you enter in the terminal "bot.py "and you use it. <br/>
Good luck!
