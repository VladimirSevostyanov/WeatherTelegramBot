WeatherTelegramBot <br/>
Go to telegram and look for @BotFather.
Create a new bot, name it and get an API that needs to be entered into TOKEN_API in config.py
Go to Openweather https://openweathermap.org. Register and go to "My API keys". Create your API key, copy it and paste it into token_weather in config.py
After you enter in the terminal "bot.py "and you use it.
Good luck!
